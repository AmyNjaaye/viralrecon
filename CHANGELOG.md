## [1.0.0] - 2020-05-29

Initial release of nf-core/viralrecon, created with the [nf-core](http://nf-co.re/) template.

This pipeline is a re-implementation of the [SARS_Cov2_consensus-nf](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/SARS_Cov2_consensus-nf) and [SARS_Cov2_assembly-nf](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/SARS_Cov2_assembly-nf) pipelines initially developed by [Sarai Varona](https://github.com/svarona) and [Sara Monzon](https://github.com/saramonzon) from [BU-ISCIII](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII). Porting both of these pipelines to nf-core was an international collaboration between numerous contributors and developers, led by [Harshil Patel](https://github.com/drpatelh) from the [The Bioinformatics & Biostatistics Group](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/science-technology-platforms/bioinformatics-and-biostatistics/) at [The Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/), London. We appreciated the need to have a portable, reproducible and scalable pipeline for the analysis of COVID-19 sequencing samples and so the Avengers Assembled!
