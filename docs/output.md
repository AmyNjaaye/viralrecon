[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarizing all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from pycoQC, samtools flagstat, samtools idxstats, samtools stats, mosdepth, BCFTools, SnpEff and QUAST.

The default [`multiqc config file`](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/assets/multiqc_config_nanopore.yaml) has been written in a way in which to structure these QC metrics to make them more interpretable in the final report.

The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

An example MultiQC report generated from a full-sized dataset can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/results).

    }
}
```

</details>

If multiple libraries/runs have been provided for the same sample in the input samplesheet (e.g. to increase sequencing depth) then these will be merged at the very beginning of the pipeline in order to have consistent sample naming throughout the pipeline. Please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage#illumina-samplesheet-format) to see how to specify these samples in the input samplesheet.

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

  * `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  * `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

### Kraken 2

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

  * `*.kraken2.report.txt`: Kraken 2 taxonomic report. See [here](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=manual#sample-report-output-format) for a detailed description of the format.

</details>

[Kraken 2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=manual) is a sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to DNA sequences. Kraken 2 examines the k-mers within a query sequence and uses the information within those k-mers to query a database. That database maps k-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain a given k-mer.

We use a Kraken 2 database in this workflow to filter out reads specific to the host genome before performing the *de novo* assembly steps in the pipeline. This filtering is not performed in the variant calling arm of the pipeline by default but Kraken 2 is still run to obtain an estimate of host reads, however, the filtering can be amended via the `--kraken2_variants_host_filter` parameter.

![MultiQC - Kraken 2 classification plot](images/mqc_kraken2_plot.png)

## Illumina: Variant calling

Unless you are using [UMIs](https://emea.illumina.com/science/sequencing-method-explorer/kits-and-arrays/umi.html) it is not possible to establish whether the fragments you have sequenced from your sample were derived via true biological duplication (i.e. sequencing independent template fragments) or as a result of PCR biases introduced during the library preparation. [picard MarkDuplicates](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037052812-MarkDuplicates-Picard-) isn't run by default because you anticipate high levels of duplication with viral data due to the size of the genome, however, you can activate it by adding `--skip_markduplicates false` to the command you use to run the pipeline. This will only *mark* the duplicate reads identified amongst the alignments to allow you to guage the overall level of duplication in your samples. You can also choose to remove any reads identified as duplicates via the `--filter_duplicates` parameter.

[BCFtools](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) can be used to call variants directly from BAM alignment files. The functionality to call variants with BCFTools in this pipeline was inspired by work carried out by [Conor Walker](https://github.com/conorwalker/covid19/blob/3cb26ec399417bedb7e60487415c78a405f517d6/scripts/call_variants.sh).

[BCFtools](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in [VCF](https://vcftools.github.io/specs.html) and its binary counterpart BCF format. BCFTools is used in the variant calling and *de novo* assembly steps of this pipeline to obtain basic statistics from the VCF output. It can also used be used to generate a consensus sequence by integrating variant calls into the reference genome.

[BEDTools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a swiss-army knife of tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. In this pipeline we use `bedtools genomecov` to compute the per-base mapped read coverage in bedGraph format, and `bedtools maskfasta` to mask sequences in a Fasta file based on intervals defined in a feature file. This may be useful for creating your own masked genome file based on custom annotations or for masking all but your target regions when aligning sequence data from a targeted capture experiment.

## Illumina: Workflow reporting and genomes

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `illumina/multiqc/`  
  * `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  * `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarizing all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from FastQC, fastp, Cutadapt, Bowtie 2, Kraken 2, iVar, samtools flagstat, samtools idxstats, samtools stats, picard CollectMultipleMetrics and CollectWgsMetrics, BCFTools, SnpEff and QUAST.

The default [`multiqc config file`](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/assets/multiqc_config_illumina.yaml) has been written in a way in which to structure these QC metrics to make them more interpretable in the final report.

The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Reference genome files

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `genome/db/`  
  * `blast_db/`: BLAST database for viral genome.
  * `kraken2_db/`: Kraken 2 database for host genome.
  * `snpeff_db/`: SnpEff database for viral genome.
  * `snpeff.config`: SnpEff config file for viral genome.

</details>

A number of genome-specific files are generated by the pipeline because they are required for the downstream processing of the results. If the `--save_reference` parameter is provided then the Bowtie 2 alignment indices, BLAST and Kraken 2 databases downloaded/generated by the pipeline will be saved in the `genome/` directory. It is recommended to use the `--save_reference` parameter if you are using the pipeline to build a Kraken 2 database for the host genome. This can be quite a time-consuming process and it permits their reuse for future runs of the pipeline or for other purposes.
